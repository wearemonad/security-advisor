# AGENTS.md

This repository packages the **security-advisor** skill for multiple AI coding agents. It follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) so the same skill works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot Agents, Kiro, OpenCode, Pi, Rovo Dev, Trae, and any other harness that reads Agent Skills.

## What this skill does

A conversational security advisor that hunts real, exploitable vulnerabilities in a codebase. Surfaces findings one at a time with concrete file:line exploit paths. Grounded in Anthropic's 2025/2026 safety research and OWASP Top 10:2025 / OWASP LLM Top 10 2025.

See [source/skills/security-advisor/SKILL.md](source/skills/security-advisor/SKILL.md) for the canonical skill.

Every `.<harness>/skills/security-advisor` directory is a symlink to `source/skills/security-advisor/`. Edit `source/`, everything else follows automatically.

## For agents reading this file

If you are an AI agent reading this file because a user is asking you to use this skill:

1. Your harness may already have loaded `SKILL.md` from your `.<harness>/skills/security-advisor/` directory. Follow its instructions.
2. If not, read [source/skills/security-advisor/SKILL.md](source/skills/security-advisor/SKILL.md) — that's the canonical skill.
3. The skill is invoked conversationally. Triggers include: "security review", "find vulnerabilities", "am I leaking secrets?", "is this endpoint safe?", or any mention of a CVE, OWASP category, auth concern, webhook signature, Prisma injection, or LLM prompt injection.
4. Progressive disclosure — the main SKILL.md is short. Reference files in `references/` load only when stack detection matches (e.g. `stack-nextjs.md` for Next.js apps, `stack-react.md` for any React project, `stack-llm-apps.md` for LLM apps).

## For humans reading this file

See [README.md](README.md) for installation and usage. Short version:

```bash
# Works with any harness listed above
